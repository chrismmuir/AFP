# Returns of the Chilean pension system

During the 80s, the Chilean pension system underwent a reform that transformed it into an individual capitalization system. The pension system structure is based on freedom and individual responsibility, as well as free competition of pension fund management companies (in Spanish: *Administradoras de Fondos de Pensiones*, or *AFP*). In 2002, a new savings method was introduced. Now, each worker can choose among five investment funds that are differentiated from one another by the proportion of resources that are invested in variable income securities. Basically, AFPs have concentrated these types of variable income securities in shares, mutual funds, tradable certificates issued by foreign banks, and other financial instruments. Currently, the improvement and inspection of Chile's pension system is a controversial issue.

The data corresponds to **monthly returns** of Chilean AFPs corresponding to the funds A, B, C, D and E, decreasing in terms of risk, in the period from *January 2010 to April 2020*. Data are available for each AFP operating under Chile's social security system: Capital Cuprum, Habitat, Modelo, PlanVital, ProVida and Uno, as well as the return of the system.
